A laser security system is a type of alarm system that uses beams of light to detect intruders.The system 
consists of a laser source, a receiver and a controller. The laser source emits a beam of light that travels 
across the protected area and reaches the receiver.The receiver senses any changes in the intensity or 
frequency of the light and sends a signal to the controller. The controller then triggers an alarm or other 
actions if an intrusion is detected. Laser security systems are often used in high-security areas such as 
banks, museums or military bases because they are very accurate and difficult to bypass.

Lasers differ from other light sources in a few significant ways. There are two features that are important 
for security systems. Unlike a light bulb or flashlight, laser light doesn't spread out, it is a narrow beam. 
And laser light is essentially a single color. Because laser light doesn't spread much, it can be sent it a long 
way and still have enough energy in a small area to trigger the security system detector. Because it's a 
single wavelength, it can put a blocking filter on the detector to let laser light through without letting 
background light onto the detector.

In addition to detecting intruders, the laser security system can also help deter potential intruders by 
providing a visible indication that the property is protected. The laser beam is not visible to the naked eye, 
but a visible laser pointer can be used to show the location of the laser tripwire. This can serve as a visual 
deterrent to potential intruders and help prevent break-ins before they occur.

Laser security system provides us the security against any crime, theft in our day-to-day life and so people 
are installing them in order to stay safe, secure and sound. Various electronic security systems can be used 
at home and other important working places for security and safety purposes. It is a great opportunity and 
source of saving man power contributing no wastage of electricity. The "Laser Security System" is an 
important helping system. Using this system robbery, thefts & crime can be avoided to large extend. 
Avoiding thieves results in the safety of our financial assets and thereby this system provides us 
protection against all.
